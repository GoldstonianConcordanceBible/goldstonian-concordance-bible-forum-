# goldstonian-concordance-bible-forum-
This repository is for discussion, interpretations, questions, and proposals related to the Goldstonian Concordance Bible ecosystem.  ## Why separate from the library? - The library stays canonical and read-only. - The forum can be lively, exploratory, and collaborative.
